And what happens in the movie theater; everyone starts clapping & whistling for the scene.The movie has not started yet, the audience has no clue about how the movie is going to unfold itself but they are already hyped up.If you take away all the cursing, kissing, smoking & drinking scenes away from the movie, then you are left with nothing but a very boring love story about a man who has all the guts to destroy himself but not enough guts to move on fairly with life after a failed love story.Now if you tell an Indian audience about this then he will definitely reply, \"but bro! Kissing, smoking & cursing scenes are that which makes a movie cool.\"And I stop writing this review. For whom should I write this review? Hopeless."

If this is what is popular taste, God be save the Indian film industry. In one of the early scenes, the hero belligerently says to his dean,
\"I am not a rebel without a cause\"..
Then who is he...as well asked by the lead actress, one of the most character less female leads to have come across in indian films. Her beauty is so wooden and stoic one wonders what attracts kabir about her. But kabir himself is no apostle...he is a die hard rude, cranky ,boozer, violent, misguided brute with no respect for anybody. He well deserves her in the meaningless proceedings of the purposeless film which fails even in basic entertainment. Shahid has immersed himself in an MCP kabir but the rest if the cast is as interesting as cardboard cutouts. The comedy track sucks and the emotional scenes make you cringe. The music is just as fittingly listless as rest of the film. If bahubali made you fall in love with films, this one will make you grow out of it. Kabir has no angst, no soul, no genuine emotion, no depth, it's all a babble without a cause. Must be skipped to protect the sanctity of film making. One star for the film for making me a rebel with a cause....stand guard against regressive cinema."

They seem to be madly in love that the scenes are mainly about being intimate without having any meaningful conversation.The guy and the girl wants to get married but are not able to do so due to family pressure. Families seem little logical here. The guy's family has not been able to control him for any of his actions.In latter part, psycho has gone crazy after girl has been forcefully married by her parents.
He gets into more and more trouble. Family gets little bothered now.
There is a happy ending for such a dark story which is unacceptable.Sad part : the guy never got treated in rehab and was never declared psycho.Good part : Hero 's acting is awesome so one point for that."

Ms Advani bears only one expression the entire movie except two scene in which she smiles.

What shocks me more than the movie itself is the reactions to the movie, I'm particular the ones supporting it whole heartedly. It only reflects the core issues with misogyny in India among men and women alike, accepting the woman as an object.

Every feminist was calling it a big example of \"Toxic Masculinity\" and \"Patriarchal\" society. Well, that was enough for me to go and watch it. I love liberal, feminist, or SJW tears.Talking about the film, I had no complaints the feminists had about the film. The movie is not trying to make you feel bad for Kabir. We all know he is kind of a loser. We see him destroying his career and life over a girl. But I could not find misogyny in the film. There were some scenes that might have hurt the sentiment of some people but then we have war films where only men die. We have films like I Spit on Your Grave, and Eden Lake. We have films like Titanic where poor Leo died because apparently women life is much more precious than a man's life. We have hundreds or thousands of films where men sacrifice everything for women. Nobody ever complained about that. Nobody even complained about the original Arjun Reddy. Because this is art we are talking about and art is not bound by rules. Shahid is playing a character of a man who is way beyond any kind of healing. You may hate the character he plays but you should not hate the actor for playing it. He did well in the film.Now, I did not like the film because it is mediocre - the dialogue is pretty bad, acting ranges from very good to very bad, editing is bad and different scenes are stitched together very incoherently. Also, the ending is awful and it is really really long. A dark movie like this does not deserve a happy ending. I saw that ending coming from miles. But these are the reasons I did not like about the film.I didn't not like it because it promotes toxic masculinity. I wonder why these SJWs cry about Freedom of Expression when films like PK are made that constantly mock a particular religion but they forget all that when films like Kabir khan are made. Also, this film does not have a single item song. There is no scene where a girl is shown in revealing dress. On the other hand, pretty much every other Bollywood film comes up with that stuff. IMO those movies are much more misogynistic as they objectify women. I never saw anybody complaining about that."

He has fallen for a girl named \"Preeti\" in this movie and he becomes possessive for the girl without knowing her feelings. Steadily, the girl becomes a slave of the lead character and does everything which he wants her to do. In the movie, she has no feelings, she has no personal or professional motives and she just enjoys the abusive relationship. This movie is about everything except the \"LOVE STORY\".

I am a fan of Arjun reddy . Although I cant speak or understand a single word of Tulu language but I have seen that film 4 times, especially last park scene is such an amazing that it makes me cry on every single time. Arjun's one words \"let's Go \" makes him so strong that time, as he owns her and that's, make that whole film so strong. While in Kabir Khan Camera Man to director fail to capture Shahid's expression and that's change everything in that moment.
I give 4 stars because I felt that camera missed so many thing on so many places . I also feel that director been safe or give a easy hand to Kaira on emotional scenes .He could push her in the last scene . Shahid is so good through out but last scene didn't worked for me .

I don't mind a lead smoking countless cigars, drinking pathetically or even doing drugs because we have seen that before in Indian movies and now gradually in our surroundings as well. The real problem which I found with this 'Masterpiece' of Sandeep Reddy is the fact that 3 hours long tell of true love is not that entertaining. It was all okay till the end of first half. But soon when the protogonist looses his cool even before the deadline set by himself and starts doing self destruction I lost all the respect for him and eventually the interest in his story. Towards ending I was so bored with his 'Ramkatha' that I was actually sad with its happy ending. Shahid was good and so was the guy who played his best bud. Overall the movie ends as a typical hindi movie where the entire family reunites, the antogonists feel guilty about their actions and ta-da \"Happy ending\". The other good thing which happened to me because of this movie is that it made me remember 'Tere Naam'. It is a classic which I had watched when I was a kid and will still rate it a better version of true love Vs Anger management/Ego problem and a more realistic one as well."

Coming to the character which is the spotlight of criticism- \"Kabir Singh\", it is true that there have been various movies which had grey characters but there is a difference in this one. It is the protagonist who is a complete jerk from 1st moment to the last & clearly they only termed it's character bad in the rejection phase.
But when he is in the relationship also & things are all rosy he's a nightmare for any girl.
Yes he is glorified & unapologetically glamorized!
I couldn't get the movie out of my head for so many days because I was so confused whether I liked the movie /not because despite feeling the passionate vibes I couldn't relate to the fact that this is the hero behaving worse than the villain for his own gf! Its support to talk idealism here as I mention again Kabir Singh is shown as the hero here , he is the victim of rejection here , he is the one we are told to sympathise with because the situation is making him behave that way! No- the rejection just enhances his natural instincts !
Only Shahid has done an impeccable job here including the actor playing Shiva!

Actually The Original Film Arjun Reddy was Not So Good , It was Only Hyped. The Chemistry Between the lead Characters Is Not Shown Correctly in both films since the Writing was Bad. The Usage of Drugs and Foul Language Was For Attraction . The story was Nothing New and the Part where the lead Character becomes a Surgeon to his court case is an exact copy of 2002 Film Flight. The Story About a Heart Broken Turned Pysco And Then Finding His Love In The End is Not A Cinematic Revolution. It's Just a basic story with Drugs , Bad Words and Kissing scenes. The Director Took Freedom But To Show what , A Story of Heart Broken which we have seen a thousand times. Udta Punjab Too uses Drugs and Foul Language With A Proper Storyline , But Here It was Used only to attract youth
The best parts of Both The Films are The Acting of Everyone , Songs and Background Score. Overall 5/10 For Both The Films."

"163" "Frankly, Kabir Singh is every man's sexual fantasy. They have really whitened and sexed up KIARA ADVANI even though she is fully clothed most of the time. I guess films that appeal to base instincts (like KABIR SINGH) will always be more successful than films that appeal to humanitarian values (like GULLY BOY). Despite some entertaining bits, Kabir Singh is mostly an average unremarkable film . The college life shown in the film is how it works in India in real life. The alpha males mark out territories between each other and even divide the females. the film is very very accurate in its depiction of college life. The college I studied in was worse than this. Kiara Aadvani - she is a real peach. Though her role wasn't that well written. Shahid's performance was impressive. Frankly, i would have liked a well made version of this. But the unimaginative editing and the tuneless heavy metal score does not help. Two of my wife's friends are doctors. They told my wife that young male doctors are usually this obnoxious. So the film is damn realistic. India is a merciless country as shown in this film. The good people at Buzzfeed India can cry as loudly as they want, it does not change reality.(5/10)"

"178" "The remake stays mostly true to the original. However, the original had better chemistry between the lead actors, hence the love story seemed more effective. While Kabir Singh is a welcome change from stereotypical love stories, this kind of love affair needs some getting used to. Through his protagonist, Sandeep bets all his cards on his leading man, making sure you either love him or hate him, but you can't ignore him.In this film, relationships come across as a blood sport where the risk of injury is high and only the strongest screw-up will survive. 'Kabir Singh' is truly the survival of the despicable. Their collective action - when they break up - is a crash course on self-flagellation. It's also a much-needed departure from the usual syrupy Bollywood love stories that showcase grand gestures.Put a ring on 'Kabir Sigh' if you are in the mood for watching a love story that's wonderfully wicked and warped.Kabir Singh is a good watch mainly because of how well the main character is balanced by Shahid Kapoor. Vanga doesn't lose sight of the journey and doesn't forget that amidst all the existentialist dilemmas and song placements, he's telling a modern tale of a toxic male which cannot be justified but has to be told in an entertaining, compelling way. And that it does!Although Sandeep Vanga does a scene-by-scene adaptation of Arjun Reddy in Kabir Singh, the new take fails to be as impactful as the original. The former also had a long run time, but as a viewer, we didn't mind it as the characters, sequences and emotions were raw. At 2 hours 52 minutes, Kabir Singh works only because of our leading man, Shahid Kapoor. He breathes life into the character of Kabir Singh and showcases a range of emotions from passion, hatred and rage bordering on lunacy. Kabir Singh will definitely click with the youngsters.Not the typical romantic saga. Unconventional, but powerful. Shahid is outstanding, career-best act. Kiara is lovely. Director Sandeep is an incredible storyteller. Overstretched runtime is a deterrent."

"205" "\"Kabir Singh\" is one of those movies which you've hard time determining if you actually liked it or not. It's completely upto the different perspectives of different sectors of audiences. But for me, it failed to pack the punch I was expecting it to.Right from the beginning of first half, the character of \"Kabir Singh\" feels like one of those generic Indian hero. Totally one dimensional & over exaggerated, yet, the perfect boy of the film. But from the second half, we actually start to see a bit of development in the character. Best part: it doesn't completely move away from its core-built-up & Shahid Kapoor deserves a lot of credit for that. It probably is Shahid Kapoor's second best performance ever after \"Haider\" & \"Jab We Met.\" But out of all things, one important point is that Shahid never really was able outperform anyone as he didn't have anyone to compete with throughout the film. That much ordinary the cast selection is.Apart from all the other potential criticisms one could debate about; what really irked me the most is how Kiara Advani was used throughout the 2 hours 50 minutes long flick featuring the ups-downs, romantic & redemption phases of one particular man even though it all started with her. She was just there to keep the film going & absolutely meant nothing otherwise.But don't get me wrong, the film by no means is only about the negative points. There are numerous positive aspects from the film that could easily make certain people fall in love with the film. One of those points is the music & how the songs were used. Both the music directors and film director worked together perfectly & created situational songs which just didn't keep the 'slightly dragged storyline' moving forward but also had significant influence on viewing experience.The other most memorable good point of the film is its crispy dialogue writing. Usage of profane language was brilliantly pulled off & it never really seemed forced for a generic Indian 'adult movie.' The profanity was very much natural & overall, they, if not the film, packed the punch right from the beginning. And how Shahid executed all the dialogues is too good to be forgotten easily.However, keeping everything aside & going deep into the story, I realised there one too many scenes which could seem offensive, taboo, annoying & all to many. Personally, one scene of Kiara Advani coming to meet Shahid Kapoor in his house was extremely disturbing due to the course of the events just right before her entry. But prior to that as well, her character always kept degrading from the beginning and by the end of the film, it was clear that she's nothing more than a mere litre of worth of cheap quality fuel for the engine of the flm. And that plays a huge role in all the criticism I'm pointing out.But here, let's talk about the story. But first, is there even a story? Yes. The trailer promises there is one. And there really is one. But is it predictable? Yes & that's fine as hardly a few unpredictable film comes out every year. But is the predictable plot different from other generic Indian films? Nope. Apart from having a \"villain\" (and that's due to the anti-hero tone of the film already), the film feels too generic to an extent where 2 hours & 50 minutes becomes really uncomfortable to handle.Allover, the experience was like a small lake with limited diameters, not so perfect shape to please the eyes & potential polluted. But waking up & having that same lake as the first sight will always please you. Same goes for the film. It's not perfect or even flawless by means. It just tries so hard to be a unique modern-day love story, with an awkward little touch of old-school Indian society's flawed philosophy. But if you ask me, I won't force you to watch it. But again... What's wrong in giving it a try either, right?"

So, I did not go with high expectations. People are going crazy about this movie. But, I knew it will not be that great. Because of its run-time. In first half, there are some boring elements. You can sense them. Though, I didn't find anything dull in second half.Shahid Kapoor is as usual great. This will not count as his best performance. But it will be remembered by many. Thus, many will go to watch this film only for SK. I have never saw these type of shouts in any Shahid Kapoor movie. Some will surely go for 2nd time. The love story represented here is absolutely raw. You can feel for the characters, Kabir and Preeti. This is the film for youngsters, especially collegians.Kiara Advani is natural. But she got very few lines. People were laughing at 50th minuet, ki Aakhirkaar pehla dialogue boli. Kabir's friend, named Shiva is superb. Arjan Bajwa and Suresh Oberoi are good.I heard each song first time Today. Bekhayali and Tujhe Kitna Chahte Rahe Hum are fab. To the point. Adding values to the story compeletely. Credit goes to lyricists Irshad Kamil and Mithoon. Others like Mere Sohneya and Kaise Hua are superb too. Will listen to all of them. In this film, I loved long takes. It is a good thing to involve viewers into your story. And there's always the suitable background music each time. And because of that only, you will get into this world only in first 5 minutes.One problem is chopping. Because it was supposed to be 184min movie and they cut it down to 174, so some parts are missing. That's why you will get questions in your head about some happenings in the story. Also, disappointed with CBFC, because Gaalis have been muted.<U+0001F622> Then why the hell is it an adult film!On the whole, if you are a youngster, you will surely have a great time. It is a rare thing that, Couples from all over India will watch this film for sure. In fact, all single rebels will go for sure as well. It means this is going to huge hit in Shahid Kapoor's career. This is a good Bollywood Movie after a long time, so go for it. Just enjoy while watching, don't keep anything into your mind from the life of Kabir Singh."

"214" "Kabir Singhis almost scene to scene replica of Arjun Reddy.The movie is about a short-tempered and brash surgeon Kabir Singh (Shahid Kapoor) and how his life changes when he falls in love with Preeti (Kiara Advani).Despite its almost 3 hour run-time, Kabir Singh keeps you hooked and engaged throughout.There is no dull moment in the film. Even when the proceedings take a dark turn.The performances were the key and Shahid Kapoor is the driving force of the film. If he had failed, the movie would've fallen flat on its face.From the different looks, the brash attitude, the short-tempered persona to the dialogue delivery, Shahid Kapoor nails it.Kiara Advani's makes a mark as Preeti. She looks beautiful and performs well. Even though her screentime is restricted, Kiara makes you fall in love with her.Cinematography is good. The music is melodious and amazing.Now coming to the downside, And a word of advice for everyone, Shahid's character is not to be idolised.He is often shown to be an a$$hole of the highest order who treats almost everyone around him as a commodity, n in one scene he treats Preeti n her father too badly and even slaps her and badmouths her father and family. (Its not nice - a wrong attitude)
But, despite all that Preeti maintains a submissive attitude., poor preeti <U+0001F614>Overall, Kabir Singh is an entertaining and engaging film. Shahid Kapoor's angry young man avatar, the melodious music and outstanding background score make it a winner. Watch it."

One of the brilliant performances of shahid Kapoor.Superb acting by shahid Kapoor. He is born for these kinds of roles. The way he Carrie's himself in this film is astonishing.Unconventional in approach, this remake of Telugu blockbuster Arjun Reddy by the same director is not the run of the mill mushy Bollywood love story of split and last-minute patch up.Guy with anger management issue and obsessed and with his girlfriend. Very possessive boyfriend. The way shahid portrayed Kabir Singh is damn good his every emotion from the start when he falls in love with Preeti how they become a couple is so adorable.This film beats the stereotype typical love stories with its intense and extreme emotional connect backed by an adrenaline pumping BGM and Characterization.It's a worth watch in the cinemas, go for it and experience a never like before tale of love.For the detailed review on Movie Kabir Singh, you can check my YouTube Channel Dil Se Review."

First think i want to clear it's a good remake but you can't watch a movie you've already watched 1 year ago but but but there is something different, only one thing I can tell you is - for me it's Shahid kapoor that's the only reason personally I enjoyed Despite knowing the story.
.
The movie is all about A Man or A Surgeon no An Alcoholic/Drug Addict Surgeon tried to heal his broken heart with Drugs and Alcohol,
We can say 21st Century's Devdas with trending style beard and with modern drugs not only with alcohol. Before Interval it was a great but after interval it gets slow somewhere but overall a worth watch. People who are in love nowadays can easily connect with the story or with the situations like I remembered those years were i used to hate myself just because I started taking drugs alot and was an Alcoholic not a bad one but without it I didn't sleep properly. Just like people are in love nowadays they'll love the story and obviously the acting and songs are like cherry of cake.
.
Everything is fine, Music, Screenplay but the person makes the movie gripping and lovely is Shahid kapoor. Madam Advani the actress is simple and with some dialogues she worked well.
It's a Nice movie. After movie Some people (girls) are saying if someone will ask my another show I'll definetly come.
So it's up to people and there interest.
I'll give 3.5 for the work/acting and songs.

"223" "Kabir Singh - So strong is Kabir's (Shahid Kapoor) control over his junior in college Preeti (Kiara Advani), that her consent to the relationship he desires is inconsequential. He has serious anger management issues but virtually rules the medical college due to his immense intelligence and top performance. As time passes by, Preeti gets so smitten by Kabir that she is almost consumed and possessed by him, to the point of an intense submissive pleasure. Preeti is therefore deemed as the mad man's muse. The problem is that her parents don't approve of the relationship and marry her off elsewhere, whilst Kabir Singh embarks on a mission of self destruction and vandalism, seeking solace in alcohol and drugs.Director Sandeep Vanga Reddy's remake of the original Telugu hit Arjun Reddy brings out Shahid Kapoor in a passionate and controlling character like never before. His romance is toxic and requires physical demonstrations. He is volatile, virile, explosive and self destructive with graphic violence and alcoholism. It's a role played to perfection. In contrast, Kiara Advani's role is poorly sketched as we fail to gather why she gives in to Kabir easily and then allows him to completely possess her, to the extent of objectification. Music by Harshvardhan Rameshwar and cinematography by S K Ravichandran are fantastic. Suresh Oberoi, Kamini Kaushal, Arjan Bajwa, Nikita Dutt and Soham Majumdar (in the role of Shiva, Kabir's best friend who stands by him in thick and thin) are absolutely first class. But the film is all about Shahid Kapoor who delivers one of his finest performances ever - especially those parts where he is a slowly decaying lover whose life has gone devoid of beauty."

Now, this intense modern-day love story will surly hit the audience pretty hard!!! With stellar performances by the lead actors, music, cinematography, background scores and almost every other thing of the movie will leave a deep impression on everyone's mind for sure. Now, talking about the logic and reality and it is found missing in some parts. Especially, that \"8 month thing\" felt illogical and dramatic and so as the climax. Now, coming to Shahid, undoubtedly this guy is a gem of an actor but underrated at the same time. But with this crazy doctor's character he did an unforgettable & mesmerizing act and it is Shahid at it's all time best till date. We can still remember his magical performances in Udta Punjab & Haider. But this one is different & definitely makes him one of the best actors of Indian cinema. The fierce, the anger, the spontaneity, the gravity, the madness every shades of him were portrayed with great elegance & ease which ultimately bring this Kabir Singh alive, brutally real and also the modern-day's \"Angriest Young Man\". Frame by frame it's only Shahid. Almost 95% screen-space were kept for Kabir only, still it did not fill monotonous and that's because of the mastery of Shahid & the director. Kiara Advani & Suresh Oberoi also did full justice to their characters. Other actors were also good. But still, a different and more realistic ending might take this movie to another level. Otherwise this experience is very impactful & paisa wasool & thus makes it a must watch!!!"

He has his own ways of dealing with particular situations & doesn't care about what others think about his actions. He is also a heavy drinker & a drug addict. And the most shocking fact is that this guy is a qualified surgeon!The film mainly shows the romantic life story of Kabir Singh & it unfolds through a flashback of his college life. After he gets temporarily suspended from college due to a fierce fight in a football match, he decides to leave the college but stays back after he gets bewitched by a 1st year MBBS girl student Preethi (Kiara Advani). Their love story unfurls in a rather alluring manner. What happens when her family forces her to marry another man? The following events form the rest of the plot.This film particularly explores Kabir's distinctive lifestyle. It shows how he maintains his doctor life inspite of him being a heavy drinker & drug addict, performing critical surgeries on his patients where a small mistake could even cost a life! The film has quite an array of raw scenes & gruesome instances. An interesting moment in the movie that I liked is a Kannada song \"Preethse Anta..\" being sung by one of Kabir's female friends during a night out scene.The performances by all the actors is convincing. Shahid Kapoor's spectacular & impulsive acting is a treat to watch. Soham Majumdar's acting as Kabir's trusted friend is touching. Kiara Advani's acting as a cute and rather innocent girl is also worth mentioning. The screenplay gets a bit slow in the 2nd half but is compensated by the brilliant climax which is quite emotional!Overall this movie has a quite distinctive story paired with some brilliant & raw performances and is a great entertaining watch!"

His performance was excellent!!! The swag , the no nonsense attitude , the anger , the various shades he added in his character by his par excellence acting skills!!! And last but not the least an extremely pure heart full with immeasurably pure love!! The multifaceted personality of Kabir Singh was wonderfully created by the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga , who's the real hero of this film ! Shahid Kapoor is the MVP and Mr Vanga is a maestro !!! Kiara Advani's full of innocence character could have been much better and had a lot of potential to grow equally as the male lead ,had she been given more screen time and a much more well written role. The music and background score were the main performers behind the curtain which created an atmosphere so surreal that one would deeply indulge in the film. They were so accurately placed alongwith the flow of the movie that they gave a complete sense of relevance!! So this movie is a must watch for those who haven't yet seen the original film Arjun Reddy (which i would advise them not to, if excited for Kabir Singh) and to those who have seen the original film , do hit the theatres if possible in order to witness Shahid's fantastic acting acumen , cuz \" he's not a rebel without a cause \" !!! The supporting cast has also done a great job with special highlight towards Arjan Bajwa & Suresh Oberoi !!! The concept is fresh , with a unique love story and I'd have been happier if Sandeep Reddy Vanga were given a fresh and original project to work on rather than a remake. Looking forward to seeing more of such great performances by Shahid Kapoor and much more fantastic projects by Mr Vanga ! Peace !!"

However, there were many parts of the movie which were uncomfortable to watch with family. The main ones were the swearing such as MC, BC, and the kissing and making out scenes. Overall this movie is good but it is strictly for entertainment and for a good time with friends. NOT A FAMILY FILM. Probably Shahid's best acting ever.

Every one knows that originals are always better than Remakes.You'll like Arjun Reddy more than Kabir Singh because Arjun Reddy looks very realistic and you get connected with the characters, you don't care about the actors.But Kabir Singh..., It doesn't touch your heart that much because it of course doesn't look realistic because it's a big production movie, they used they're money as much as they could. So it all looks like a movie. And the actors are also very big, so they also give you a movie feel , so that's why this movie doesn't touch your heart."

"298" "It's a shame in a beautifully diverse country like India even movies are dragged in \"bad propaganda\".Keeping the unnecessary propagandas aside, Talking about kabir singh. It is by far one of the best remake ever in Indian cinema. The story-line being very ordinary with a twist. However, what makes kabir singh a master piece is shahid Kapoor who makes an ordinary story line something completely out of this world. Every scene Shahid is in, he lives it king size and flawless connects with every broken heart specially in the subcontinent. Even the strong hearted at some point will get some chills at some point in the movie. That's what kabir singh does. brings out raw emotions. This film has done an excellent job in portraying the script to the point, Shahid surely deserves a pay rise after this performanc. 8/10 only because it's not an original concept.
10/10 for shahid. other characters are only revolving around shahid. saying that, credit to kiara she looks stunning on the silver screen and has the potential to go further. some work needed on her acting with time, I suppose she must do good. considering she is a new comer. she has done excellent work.

"310" "Kabir Singh - an Official remake of 'Arjun Reddy' directed by Sandeep Vanga. after release of Trailer, It has created a big buzz and it's one of the promosing and awaiting movie of these year. also its looks like one of the best of Shahid's till date. Kabir Singh will appeal to youth audiences. Familiar audiences will stay away due to Adult Certificate. Will Kabir Singh match to public's expectations or not? Let's analyze it.Storyline:
Story has nothing new to offer. We have seen similar stories before many times. Best example is Devdas. Movie starts with Portraying Kabir Singh (Shahid Kapoor) and then goes in flash back, where we introduced by love story of Kabir Singh and Preethi (Kaira Advani). Both loves eachother but Preethi's family is against relationship and Preethi marries to some other person. There starts Self destruction of Kabir Singh. He starts finishing himself in Smoking, Alcohol & Drugs. Will Kabir Singh gets Preethi in Climax? Will audience get happy ending or tragic end?Performances:
Shahid Kapoor has delivered one of his brilliant performance of his Career. before these He has given class performances in 'Udta Punjab', 'Kaminey' & 'Haider' but these was far one. Kiara Advani looks beautiful and also perfomed neck to neck upstanding performance with Shahid Kapoor. Soham Majumdar, who plays the role of Shahid's friend has given incredible performance. Soham makes reminds of Sarfaraz Khan from 'Tere Naam' as best friend. Other Characters, Arjan Bajwa as Shahid's Brother & Suresh Oberoi as Shahid's Father helps movie to run forward.Music:
Amazing & Humming. Bekhayali - rocked it.Direction:
Director Sandeep Vanga has directed its very well and not a hard part for him as it's his own adaption of Telegu version. He has done better job with Kabir Singh then Arjun Reddy.Overall, Kabir Singh is heart touching. A complete pack of Romance, Drama, Emotions & Strong acts. Its a treat for romantic movie lovers. A must watch."

"313" "I haven't watched Arjun reddy so can't compare it with Kabir singh but shahid has shown how underrated he was all the time as an actor,this man pulls of a once in a year performance (remember Ranbir Kapoor in sanju).Kabir Singh is a sweet love story that will be loved by every class of audience.It starts with shahid as a womanizer and ends with shahid as one woman man.
being the ruthless Kabir to helpless Kabir Shahid shows his class.he shows intensity when shouts and looks in pain when drunk.a master class act.
Kiara looks stunning she doesn't has much dialogues to deliver but she still manages to over shadow Shahid in few scenes.
Shiva,Shahid frnd brings the humour that keeps the pace of the movie steady
Arjan bajwa along with Suresh oberai do justice with their roles.So if you are still deciding whether to watch this one or not book your tickets right now you will not regretKudos Shahid Kabir Singh Kapoor"

The premise obviously is two Indian youths who find their absolute freedom in college, but external life can hardly be called same where the two find no one to support their love except for an elderly woman standing on the cusp of her death, but she is as powerless as these two.Eventually we realize that how everything is a pretense and everything kind of works out but not before it is too late for almost everyone. So, reality happened and everyone lost something.Shahid has easily expended his potential in the film and he assures that he will be remembered, same can also be said about Kiara in her mostly silent role. The film has its issues in the way women are objectified without having any real power, but in other ways this is a hope for Indian cinema to take tough decisions and make an enjoyable A certified movie. I would have gone with an 8 but the thought process behind forces me to push that up to a 9."

"409" "Ok, Kabir Singh is not your picture perfect protagonist and neither the director tried to show him in that light.It's about a guy who's not perfect, has anger issues but has fallen in love and doesn't want to move on after he's hurt. For him, she is everything.It's not your KJO type movie wherein the protagonist is a hero who won't do a bad thing, his families are happy with him, his neighbors are happy and the entire college or city is happy with him.It's a story about a flawed person which is totally normal in real life. Don't we have such friends or colleagues or people around us who we may not like but they are like that? So, if you feel it's patriarchal and misogynistic, it is but it is that story about that man! Period.Through his perspective, we realized he was pure and didn't believe in casteism that comes in the way of love. Have we not come across that? Do we not become partial to other castes? My own marriage had almost become a victim of casteism but we held our own and now happily married for many years.We saw a full circle of Kabir who was a sensitive child in love with a doll but was also possessive. We saw how he became protective for a new girl in college and she being a docile, submissive girl also fell in love with him. She loved him. It's not like he forced himself on her.He got hurt, did wrong things but still was a man of morals and came out clean when needed. He acknowledged himself that's the only thing he liked about himself.His coming of age while talking to his father when the latter was down in his life, shows his character development wonderfully written by Vanga. I'm his fan now.Lots of hints are thrown out in open here's a guy with so many issues is the topper of his college, did what the society wanted of him which is to be topper, study well, be a doctor but then he didn't give a damn about what he wanted to do in his personal life and what others thought of him.Other things he did when he did while womanizing he was broken and hurt. People when hurt deal with their issues differently. While some throw their phones on the floor in anger, others may just tell themselves to get up and go. Was he right? It's about his story and life, not ours.Need to view that story from that perspective and feel his pain and disagree where you didn't like it. But you can't say it's glorifying his wrong deeds.Was Padmavat glorifying Khilji's work or GoT glorifying nudity and butchering?I loved this new type of love story. The team worked hard and I loved all the characters in the film especially his friend Shiva - a true real raw friendship.Kiara was beautiful and could be the next big sensation as Disha did after MS Dhoni.Shahid can finally be sure his father is proud of his work. Never felt it was him and not Kabir for a second.Request to the viewers to not be judgemental and watch it for what it is. Mind you, you'd not be disappointed. Peace!"

Its a must watch and comes from a very real place.
Music is soulful and the intensity grips you right from the start.
Kiara looks breathtakingly beautiful. A Must Watch."

The dialogues are outstanding. I guess the best movie of Shahid Kapoor. A worth watch.
Even though the movie is a dubbed version of Arjun Reddy, it still is great to watch."
